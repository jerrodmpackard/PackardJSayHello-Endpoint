Say Hello - Endpoint
Created an endpoint to take in a user's name and return a greeting.
Peer review by: Aidan Younathan
Peer review comments: The Endpoint works well and I like the extra flare you added to it. The only thing is that with your code it can be simplified. You can remove line 9 and add public string to line 15 so that its shorter. Other than that its exactly what it needs to be so good job!
